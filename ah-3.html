Since the 1950s poultry farming in India has changed tremendously. From being an unorganized and non-scientific system it has transformed itself to a more systematic, planned, scientific, commercial and organized farming practice.  From being a backyard farming practice it is now full-fledged techno-commercial industry.

Although the production is mainly achieved through commercial means, the rural poultry sector also contributes significantly to the Indian poultry industry. It is looked upon as a reliable economic and nutritional source.</p>

<b class="b11">Housing for Poultry Farming</b>
<hr class="hr">
<p class="fcc2">Poultry shelters are the next important factor after farm sites in poultry rearing. The shelters must be raised adequately to prevent the risk of flooding. It should be spacious enough to permit free movement and running of the birds. In addition the shelter must be adequately ventilated and protected from sunlight. It is advisable to construct the shelters in a south facing direction. In this way, the birds are not only protected from the harsh sunlight but also permit circulation of fresh, clean air. There should be adequate drainage facilities in the shelter. Also if there is more than one shelter then the distance between two of them must be at least 50 feet. This would ensure proper ventilation and non-accumulation of ammonia inside the shelters. The entrances in the shelter must be fastened properly. Also there should be fencing around the shelter to secure the birds. The shelter design however depends on the breed of poultry, type of production, etc.</p>
