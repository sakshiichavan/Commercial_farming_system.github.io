<i><b>Organic farming in India is gaining popularity day by day. One can get organic certification by strictly following organic farming methods. Organic produces have great market value and demand. Learn what is organic farming and how you can convert your land into a certified organic farm./b></i>
<hr class="hr">

<p class="fcc2">The system of organic farming is not a new concept and has been in practice since ancient times in India. The primary aim of organic farming is to help soil stay in good health through the use of biological wastes, organic wastes and bio-fertilizers. Using organic manures help in sustainable crop production along with a pollution-free environment. Sometime it is called ‘green farming’. As per the US Department of Agriculture-</p>

<b class="b">Need for Organic Farming in India</b>
<hr class="hr">
<img src="of3-1.jpg">
<div class="desc2" style="text-align: left;">Organic farming in India</div>

<p class="fcc2">Ever increasing population as opposed to an ever decreasing supply of living resources like food and water has made it necessary to increase the agricultural production and stabilize it in a viable and feasible manner. The benefits of ‘Green Revolution’ credited to Dr. MS Swaminathan have now reached a plateau and with diminishing returns it has become necessary to devise alternate techniques. In addition, the excess use of fertilizers and artificial growth regulators has led to an issue called ‘pollution’. The need of the hour is a natural balance between life and property for existence. Keeping in view the fact that fossil fuels are on their way of extinction and are non-renewable, organic, nature friendly ways of farming and agriculture has gained importance.</p>

<b class="b">Concept of Organic Farming</b>
<hr class="hr">
<p class="fcc2">Organic farming is a very native concept to India. It is based on the following principles:</p>
<ul class="fcc2">
    <li>Soil is a living entity. </li>
    <li>Nature is the best teacher for farming since it does not use any external nutrients or additional water.</li>
    <li>The living population of the soil is protected and nurtures. The natural micro-organisms in soil are not harmed in any way.</li>
   </ul>
<p class="fcc2">Thus organic farming is a system of farming that aims at keeping the soil alive, maintaining its good health, cultivating the land and then raising the crops. This must be done to maintain a pollution-free environment and in an ecological manner.</p>

<b class="b">Salient Features of Organic Farming</b>
<hr class="hr">
<p class="fcc2">Some of the salient features of organic farming include:</p>
<ul class="fcc2">
    <li>Protecting soil fertility</li>
    <li>Maintaining the level of organic matter</li>
    <li>Encouraging biological activity in soils</li>
    <li>Providing nutrients through the microbial action</li>
    <li>Recycling organic matter like crop residues and manures</li>
</ul>

<b class="b">Emergence of Organic Agriculture in India</b>
<hr class="hr">
<p class="fcc2">In India, organic agriculture is being increasingly adopted by farmers. They can be divided into 3 different categories:/p>

<b class="b11">Category 1</b>
<hr class="hr">
<p class="fcc2">For farmers living in a no-input zone, organic farming is a way of life. It has been practiced by them since ages and is a traditional way of doing agriculture.</p>

<b class="b11">Category 2</b>
<hr class="hr">
<p class="fcc2">In wake of the ill-effects of conventional agricultural practices and owing to the misuse of fertilizers, farmers who have recently adopted organic farming fall under this category.</p>

<b class="b11">Category 3</b>
<hr class="hr">
<p class="fcc2">This category includes farmers who have systematically adopted organic agriculture to capture the market commercially.
    <br>
    Most farmers fall under the first category but they are not certified farmers. Certified farmers are in the third category while both certified and non-certified farmers are included in the second category.</p>

<b class="b">Regulatory Body and Organic Certification</b>
<hr class="hr">
<p class="fcc2">Since India has traditionally been practicing organic farming, there is a regulatory body that ensures quality.</p>
<ul class="fcc2">
    <li>National Program on Organic Production (NPOP) is the authority defining the regulatory mechanism. They have two different bodies for regulation in the domestic and export markets.</li>
    <li>Under Foreign Trade Development Regulation Act, NPOP looks after the export requirements.</li>
    <li>Under Agriculture Produce Grading, Marking and Certification Act, it looks after the domestic market and imports.</li>
</ul>

<b class="b">Organic Farm Management</b>
<hr class="hr">
<p class="fcc2">Since the entire concept of organic farming revolves around a healthy, living soil crop residue management, effective crop rotation, proper cropping patterns etc. must be practiced carefully. This ensures optimum productivity without any fertility loss. In addition, organic systems also respect the natural ecology of the area such as the weather, flora and fauna of the place, the native animals there etc.
    <br><br>
    One of the first steps in organic farming is to understand the area and basic requirements following which the long term strategies must be addressed. Some of the problems faced by the country are:</p>
<ul class="fcc2">
    <li>Poor soil health due to loss of organic matter and soil microbes.</li>
    <li>Increased temperature</li>
    <li>Costly high inputs as opposed to lower returns.</li>
</ul>

<p class="fcc2">To combat the above issues, a productive, sustainable and cost-effective system must be developed. In order to devise a strategy the first few considerations are:</p>

<b class="b11">Rain Water Conservation</b>
<hr class="hr">
<p class="fcc2">Rain water harvesting is an important step in organic farming considering the fact that the only source of irrigation are the seasonal rains, local ponds, lakes, and wells. Therefore, percolation tanks, farm ponds must be dug and cultivation must be practiced in bunds or contours.</p>

<b class="b11">Soil Enrichment</b>
<hr class="hr">
<p class="fcc2">Since soil is a living entity, it must be enriched to the maximum extent. The golden rule here is to circulate the crop residues, cattle droppings, and every other biological waste back to the field. Every biological waste taken away must be replaced in the field.  In other words, every nutrient, waste, and other resources from the field is accountable. In case of soils deficient in nutrients, mineral grade rock phosphate and lime are added through composting or directly. Bio-fertilizers, compost, bio-nutrients etc. must be used. Synthetic fertilizers, artificial nutrients etc. are a strict no-no.</p>

<b class="b11">Maintaining Natural Habitat</b>
<hr class="hr">
<p class="fcc2">The natural habitat must not be destroyed or disturbed with through the use of pesticides and other such synthetic chemicals.</p>

<b class="b11">Other Techniques</b>
<hr class="hr">
<p class="fcc2">Using techniques like vermicomposting, developing own seed varieties, farm compost production, using botanical extracts and liquid manures are other ways of organic farming.</p>

<b class="b">Organic Farming Methods</b>
<hr class="hr">
<img src="of3-2.jpg">
<div class="desc2" style="text-align: left;">Organic Farming Methods</div>
<p class="fcc2">In order to certify a farm as organic, there are a set of minimum requirements. You should strictly follow these organic farming methods. These maybe enlisted as below:</p>

<b class="b11">Conversion Period</b>
<hr class="hr">
<p class="fcc2">Organic farming in India has some disadvantages also. If the farmers are practicing conventional farming and the field is not fully organic then the farmer must have a conversion plan. The time interval between the beginning of organic operations and certification is the ‘conversion’ period. The exact time period is decided taking into consideration the ecology of the land and its previous use. Conversion period is also applicable if the field is partially organic. However the organic and inorganic fields must be clearly marked and maintained separately. Gradually, over a period of time the entire farm including the livestock must be converted to organic. On an average, the conversion period is three years for perennials and two years for annuals.</p>

<b class="b11">Mixed Farming</b>
<hr class="hr">
<p class="fcc2">This is a practice of agricultural farming wherein there is not just cultivation of crops but also other farming such as animal husbandry, sericulture, pisciculture or fish farming, poultry management, etc. In other words, mixed farming is integration of animals into the farming system to ensure soil fertility and crop yield.</p>

<b class="b11">Planting in Organic Farming</b>
<hr class="hr">
<p class="fcc2">Often farmers forget that they must plant what the weather, climate and soil of the area allows. They must cultivate what is native to the soil. In case otherwise, the species or variety chosen for cultivation must be adapted to the soil. The planting material and seeds must be procured from a reliable source that is certified organic by the authorizing body. In case ‘organic’ ones are not available then chemically untreated planting material should be used. Pollen culture seeds, tissue culture seeds, transgenic plants, genetically engineered seeds are also not allowed.</p>

<b class="b11">Manure Requirements</b>
<hr class="hr">
<img src="of3-3.jpg">
<div class="desc2" style="text-align: left;">Vermicompost in organic farming</div>
<p class="fcc2">The fertility of the soil must be maintained through use of leguminous crops, green manure crops, etc. Biodegradable materials are used as manures. These materials must be of animal or plant origin. Crop and animal residues must be recycled back into the soil directly or indirectly. Manures like vermicompost, sheep penning, farm yard manure, compost etc. are allowed but chemical fertilizers are not. In case the soil requires mineral-based manuring for organic fields, then the products that can be used for manuring are:</p>
<ul class="fcc2">
    <li>Sodium chloride</li>
    <li>Magnesium rocks</li>
    <li>Biodynamic preparations</li>
</ul>

<b class="b">Profitability of Organic Farming in India</b>
<hr class="hr">
<p class="fcc2">If the right market can be accessed then organic farming in India is very profitable. Profit increases in mainly two ways-</p>
<ol class="fcc2">
    <li>Cost of farm input reduces by using crop and animal residue, organic waste as bio-fertilizer.</li>
    <li>Market value and demand of organic product is high compared to traditionally grown farm produces.</li>
</ol>
<p class="fcc2">There is also a very good export potential of organic produces but organic farming methods must be strictly followed and along with organic certification from authorizing body.</p>

<b class="b">Conclusion</b>
<hr class="hr">
<p class="fcc2">To conclude with, organic farming in India is a safe venture although it may take a while to establish and become fully functional. There are government subsidies available for the commercial aspects. If organic farming methods can be strictly followed, required organic certification is acquired and have access to the right market then organic farming in India is very profitable.</p>
