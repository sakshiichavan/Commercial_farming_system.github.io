If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Sites or order, receive or use products made available through the Sites (collectively, the “Products”).</p>
  
  <p>These Terms do not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other agreement you may have with us in respect of any products, services or otherwise.

  <p>Fresh Fields reserves the right to change or modify these Terms at any time and in our sole discretion. If we make changes to these Terms, we will provide notice of such changes, such as by sending an email notification, providing notice through the Sites or updating the “Last Updated” date at the beginning of these Terms. By continuing to access or use the Sites or order, receive or use Products, you confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms and all of the terms incorporated therein by reference.

  <p>In the event you cancel your Farm Box Subscription, please note that we may still send you promotional communications about Fresh Fields, unless you opt out of receiving those communications by following the unsubscribe instructions provided therein.</p>
  
  <h2>4.2 Gifts</h2>
  <p>You have the ability to purchase subscriptions for other people through the Sites through Gift Cards (“Gifts”).</p>
  <p>When you purchase a Gift, we will send an email to the Gift recipient that can be used to redeem the Gift. The Gift recipient will be required to create a Fresh Fields account which includes placing a credit card on file in order to access the Sites and redeem the Gift. Gifts are not refundable or redeemable for cash, unless otherwise required by applicable law. However, Gifts do not expire, and any unused balance will be placed in the Gift recipient’s Fresh Fields account.</p>
  
  <h2>4.3 Free Trials</h2>
  <p>From time to time, to the extent legally permitted, we may offer free trials of certain subscriptions for specified periods of time without payment that you may sign up for. If we offer you a free trial, the specific terms of your free trial will be provided in the marketing materials describing the particular trial or at registration. However, a Fresh Fields account, which includes placing a credit card on file in order to access the Sites, will be required.</p>
  <p>IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR SUCH A FREE TRIAL, ONCE YOUR FREE TRIAL ENDS, WE (OR OUR THIRD-PARTY PAYMENT PROCESSOR) WILL BEGIN BILLING YOUR DESIGNATED PAYMENT METHOD ON A RECURRING BASIS FOR YOUR SUBSCRIPTION (PLUS ANY APPLICABLE TAXES AND OTHER CHARGES) FOR AS LONG AS YOUR SUBSCRIPTION CONTINUES, UNLESS YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION PRIOR TO THE END OF YOUR FREE TRIAL. INSTRUCTIONS FOR CANCELING YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ARE DESCRIBED ABOVE. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A NOTICE FROM US THAT YOUR FREE TRIAL HAS ENDED OR THAT THE PAID PORTION OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION HAS BEGUN. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MODIFY OR TERMINATE FREE TRIALS AT ANY TIME, WITHOUT NOTICE AND IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION.</p>
  
  <h2>4.4 Payment and Billing Information</h2>
  <p>By providing a credit card or other payment method that we accept, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the designated payment method and that you authorize us (or our third-party payment processor) to charge your payment method for the total amount of your subscription or other purchase (including any applicable taxes and other charges) (collectively, as applicable, an “Order”). If the payment method cannot be verified, is invalid or is otherwise not acceptable, your Order may be suspended or cancelled. You must resolve any problem we encounter in order to proceed with your Order. In the event you want to change or update payment information associated with your Fresh Fields account, you can do so at any time by logging into your account and editing your payment information.</p>
  <p>You acknowledge that the amount billed may vary due to promotional offers, changes to your Farm Box Subscription, changes in applicable taxes or other charges, and you authorize us (or our third-party payment processor) to charge your payment method for the corresponding amount.</p>
  
  <h2>4.5 Pricing and Availability</h2>
  <p>All of our Products are subject to availability, and we reserve the right to impose quantity limits on any Order, to reject all or part of an Order, to discontinue offering certain Products and to substitute Products (including, but not limited to, specific produce items) without prior notice. We strive to provide you with high-quality Products, and given the perishable nature of certain Products and market conditions beyond our control, we may be required to make substitutions from time to time. If you are not satisfied with a substitution, please contact us at contactus@farmfreshtoyou.com.</p>
  <p>When you subscribe to your Farm Box Subscription, you are agreeing to pay the total subscription price for the mix of items included in that delivery. The items originally chosen for your farm box (subscription produce items) add up to total your subscription price. Individual prices are not available for these specific items as your purchase is of the mixed box, not the individual items. Your order total may never fall below your subscription amount.</p>
  <p>If you add extra produce items and go over your subscription price, you will pay the displayed Market Specials price, which is a discounted price, on the extra produce items in addition to your subscription amount.</p>
  <p>Market Special items swapped into your base subscription will no longer maintain the Market Special price. Only all produce items purchased in addition to or above your minimum subscription amount will be charged at displayed Market Special pricing.</p>
  
  <h2>4.6 Deliveries</h2>
  <p>You are responsible for inspecting all Products you receive from us for any damage or other issues upon delivery. In addition, you are solely responsible for determining the freshness of the Products you receive. You should always inspect your delivery to confirm that the Products arrive in a cool condition. We recommend that you use a thermometer to ensure that the temperature zone within the container in which there is dairy, meat, some higher moisture cheeses, refrigerated eggs or diced/chopped produce is 40° F or below. In the event that such temperature zone is above 40° F, or you have any other reason to believe that any other Product in your delivery is not suitable for consumption, contact us at contactus@farmfreshtoyou.com and discard the item. To maintain the quality and integrity of the Products, we recommend that you immediately refrigerate all perishable Products upon delivery and follow the USDA instructions on refrigeration and food safety, which can be found here. From the time of delivery, the condition and consumption of the Products are solely at your risk, and you are solely responsible for the proper and safe washing, handling, preparation, storage, cooking, use and consumption of the Products following delivery. We recommend that you follow the USDA’s instructions on safe food handling, which can be found here. Failure to follow safe food handling practices and temperature recommendations may increase the risk of foodborne illness. In addition, pregnant women, young children, the elderly and individuals with compromised immune systems should follow the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s recommendations on food consumption for at-risk groups, which can be found here.</p>
  <p>Our delivery driver will leave the package for you at your door during our normal delivery hours (home: night delivery between 8 pm and 8 am, and office: day delivery between 8 am and 5pm). Depending on the season and temperature in your geographic area at the time of delivery, advance planning by you should be made for proper storage of your products prior to consumption.</p>
  <p>In the case of inclement weather or other events beyond our control that interfere with our ability to deliver your Order, we will attempt to deliver your Order as soon as reasonably possible. In some cases, delivery may occur prior to the scheduled delivery date. In the event that timely delivery of your Order is not feasible, we will cancel your Order for the period so affected and issue you a credit or refund of the purchase price for that farm box delivery.</p>
  
  <h2>4.7 No Resale</h2>
  <p>You are not permitted to resell or otherwise use the Products for commercial purposes.</p>

  <h2>4.8 Product Descriptions</h2>
  <p>Fresh Fields attempts to be as accurate as possible. However, Fresh Fields does not warrant that product descriptions, photos, or other content of any product is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If a product offered by Fresh Fields itself is not as described, your sole remedy is to receive a refund for the product. We at Fresh Fields are farmers and know that farmers cannot grow items that are all perfect and all exactly uniform. For this reason, weights displayed are approximate and intended to communicate approximate amounts of produce that you will receive. While we don’t anticipate weights to be incorrect, your sole remedy for any error or documented weight-related issue will be resolved via a credit or refund for the product in question.</p>
  
  <h2>4.9 Returns and Refunds</h2>
  <p>If you are dissatisfied with any product, please contact us at contactus@farmfreshtoyou.com within 48 hours of your delivery and, depending on the circumstances, we will provide you a full or partial credit or refund of the purchase price for that box or product. We may require the return or photographic documentation of any product with which you are dissatisfied before we provide you a replacement, credit or refund.</p>
