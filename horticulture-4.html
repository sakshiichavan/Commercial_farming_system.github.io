<i><b>Cashew plantation in India is a very profitable agrobusiness. Here is the complete guidance on cashew nut cultivation from seed selection to cultivation to pest control of cashew plants and harvesting.</b></i>
<hr class="hr">

<b class="b">Cashew Tree Information</b>
<hr class="hr">
<p class="fcc2">The tropical evergreen plant cashew (Anacardium occidentale), also known as Kaju plant or Kaju badam tree usually develops as high as 46 ft, while dwarf cashew grows up to 20 ft. With an earlier maturity, higher yield, and increasing demand in the market, cashew has been one of the most preferred choices of farming to cultivators. Being native of Central American and South East Central Brazil, it was first cultivated in the Malabar Coast of India. With high potential to earn foreign exchange, Indian cultivators started growing it commercially since 1920.</p>

<b class="b">Varieties of Cashew Plants</b>
<hr class="hr">
<p class="fcc2">There are many varieties available for commercial cashew plantation in India. Here are some cashew varieties developed by and/or suitable for different states in India-</p>
     
<ul class="fcc2">
<li><b>Tamil Nadu – </b>Virudhachalam-1,-2, -3, VRI 4, VRI (CW)- H1</li>
<li><b>Maharashtra -</b> Vengurla-1/ Vengurla-2/ Vengurla-3/ Vengurla-4/ Vengurla-5/ Vengurla-6/ Vengurla-7</li>
<li><b>Goa – </b>Goa-1</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b class="b">Technical Requirements for Cashew Plantation</b>
<hr class="hr">

<b class="b11">Ideal Soil for Cashew Plantation</b>
<hr class="hr">
<p class="fcc2">Cashew can do well when grown in deep, sandy loam well-drained soil, even though they can be grown in poor soils too. Sandy red soil, coastal sandy soils, and laterite soils are great for cashew plantation. Cultivators should be careful about flooding or water stagnation in the field which damages plant growth. Also, the pH level of soil should be up to 8.0 at the maximum level. Pure sandy soil enriched with minerals can also be chosen for growing cashew.</p>

<b class="b11">Climate for Cashew Nut Cultivation</b>
<hr class="hr">
<p class="fcc2">Areas with annual rainfall of 1000-2000 mm and temperature ranging between 20 to 30°C are best for cashew nut cultivation. For best results it needs a well-defined dry weather condition for a minimum of 4 months while heavy rainfall with erratic climate is not favorable for it. Excess temperature above 36° C especially during flowering and fruiting period could affect adversely to maintain fruit standard.</p>

<b class="b11">Propagation of Cashew Tree</b>
<hr class="hr">

<b class="b11"><i>Air Layering</i></b>
<hr class="hr">
<p class="fcc2">Propagation through air layering could be successful even though cashew plantations raised through the process are quite vulnerable to drought and under such condition; the chance of survival rate is low. Therefore, growers in areas which are prone to drought should better go for epicotyl grafting which has received great response from all regions for its success rate.</p>

<b class="b11"><i>Grafting</i></b>
<hr class="hr">
<p class="fcc2">For epicotyl grafting, lively seedlings with stones need to be uprooted from the nursery bed at an early stage and they should be beheaded keeping a height of 8-10 cm. By giving a downward parallel cut of 4-6 cm deep in the middle of the decapitated stalk will produce a fissure in the stem. After that, the wedged scion should be inserted into the fissure of the rootstock in a way so that when combined, the rootstock and scion matches perfectly with each other. Take a polythene strip of 100-120 mm gauge thickness and bind the graft joint quite firmly.
    <br><br>
    The polythene strip size should be 30 cm in length and 1.5 cm in width. Further the tied graft should be planted in a poly bag of 30×20 sq cm size of 300-350 gauge filled with a mixture of soil, sand and cow dung at 2:1:1 ratio. The plastic bag should have some drainage holes on it. Make sure that the graft joint remains above the soil level within the plastic bag and the bag should be watered thoroughly. Success rate of epicotyl grafting is as high as 70%, however, requires good temperature, high humidity level, and hygiene to avoid fungal diseases in cashew nut plantation.</p>

<b class="b11">Land Preparation and Planting</b>
<hr class="hr">
<p class="fcc2">The land needs to be thoroughly ploughed that fosters aeration and helps in moisture conservation. It should be prepared before monsoon (April to June). Pits measuring 60cm X 60cm X 60cm should be dug keeping a spacing of 7×7 m for having a standard planting set. (Ideally fit to produce 204 grafts/ hectare land).</p>

<br>

<b class="b11"><i>Guidelines for Application</i></b>
<hr class="hr">
<ul class="fcc2">
   <li>Apply half of the above dose in June beginning while the remaining part should be applied during 1st week of August. If growing in low quality soil than depending on the soil properties, the dosage of nutrients should be modified;</li>
   <li>Areas where high density cashew plantation is carried out, application of fertilizer needs to be decided based on the area rather than per tree basis;</li>
   <li>For organic farming, consider applying nutrients from natural sources such as organic manure and FMY or pig or poultry manure, fish meal, oil cakes, vermicompost, bone meal etc.;</li>
   <li>Dig a ring of 15 cm depth 1.5 m away from plants for applying nutrients/ fertilizers. The area should be well mulched with soil and leaves.</li>
</ul>

<b class="b11">Training and Pruning</b>
<hr class="hr">
<p class="fcc2">Remove lateral stalks up to a height of 2-2.5 M from the ground that helps plants to spread out from the upper part of the trunk. Consider pruning diseased and wounded branches on periodical basis (more during the rainy season) that helps kaju plants avoid disease infestation.</p>

<b class="b11">Top working</b>
<hr class="hr">
<p class="fcc2">The technique of top working has emerged as a revolutionary method to boost yield level in poor performing clones and plants under the age groups of 10 – 20 years. Top working involves beheading plants at their 0.5 meter height from the ground level and then they should be treated with a paste of BHC@50% wettable powder and copper oxychloride of 50 gram each mixing with a little water that helps protect them from potential infection by pathogens and borer insects. Plants being top worked grow quite dynamically owing to their deep-rooted root system.</p>

<b class="b11">Inter-cultivation in Cashew Nut Plantation</b>
<hr class="hr">
<p class="fcc2">Before the cashew plants start producing yield, farmers can consider having inter-cultivation within the spacing of the land that offers an opportunity to continue income with no gapping. Usually, crops that can be grown during these four years include ground nuts, turmeric, cucurbits, ginger, chilli apart from pineapple and papaya.</p>

<b class="b">Cashew Production and Uses</b>
<hr class="hr">
<p class="fcc2">Apart from Goa that takes the leading position to grow cashew nut, nowadays, it is widely developed in commercial set up in the states of Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Maharashtra and in different parts of North Eastern hilly regions.
    <br><br>
    Aside from extensively taken as nutritional snacks, cashew nuts are used in preparation of cashew butter, cashew cheese and have high demand in food product industries. The shell of cashew seed is also used in a variety of applications like paints, waterproofing, arms production and more. The pulp of cashew apple that grows in yellow and reddish color is processed and used for producing fruit drinks and sweets.
    <br><br>
    So, cashew plantation in India can be very profitable is the plantation is managed carefully.</p>
